// privilege, and the whole section is withheld from anyone who can open none of
// the tabs — a hidden tab beats one that only 403s on click.
//
// The Registers item's requiredPrivilege (RISK_VIEW_RISKS) is also satisfied
// by being named on a risk: a grant-less Action Owner gets a synthetic
// RISK_VIEW_RISKS from useRiskPrivileges (GET /api/v1/risks/me/involvement), so
// they still see the section and the Registers tab — but nothing else — for the
// risk they were handed.
