// Oxygen UI's dark theme gives Paper/Card a near-black background
// (background.paper: "#000000b8"), which is indistinguishable from the
// page background. This override lightens the card so it reads as a
// distinct surface in dark mode, matched across every card/table/chart
// container in the Risk module (Add Risk, Dashboard, Analytics, Registers).
