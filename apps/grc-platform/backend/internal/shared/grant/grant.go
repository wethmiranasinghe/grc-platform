// Package grant resolves a caller's role grants into the privileges they hold,
// and — crucially — into the privileges they hold *in a particular scope*.
//
// Roles are assigned in this platform's own database, not in Asgardeo, which
// authenticates users and nothing more. A grant is a triple of (user, role,
// scope): either GLOBAL, meaning every scope the role's module defines, or one
// specific team.
//
// The problem this package exists to solve is that a user no longer has one
// privilege set. Someone may be Risk Owner in one register and Risk Assigner in
// another; flattening those into a single set would let them approve, as owner,
// a risk belonging to the register where they are merely an assigner. HasIn
// answers the question that matters — "may this user do X on THIS thing?" —
// scoped to the team whose authority governs the action. PrivilegeMap exposes
// the flattened union for the handful of call sites with no object in hand.
