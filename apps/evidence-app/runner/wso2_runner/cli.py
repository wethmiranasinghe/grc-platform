    Talks to GET {server}/api/runner-config (see
    backend/app/api/routes/runner_config.py), which hands back
    {"asgardeo_org": ..., "asgardeo_client_id": ...} with no auth required —
    the Runner needs these before it can log in at all, so there is no
    token yet to present.

    On any failure this prints a plain message naming the URL that was
    tried and raises typer.Exit(1) — it never returns a partial dict. The
    whole reason `--server` exists is to stop a fresh Runner from silently
    inheriting the http://localhost:8000 default in config.py, which looks
    configured but polls nothing. A --server that half-works (e.g. writes
    CLOUD_URL but not the org, because the response was odd) recreates
    exactly that trap in a new shape: `configure` would exit 0, the file
    would exist, and the Runner would still fail to reach anything real.
    Better to write nothing at all and make the operator try again.
