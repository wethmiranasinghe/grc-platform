"""Unit tests for `wso2_runner.config.RunnerSettings`.

These pin the runner's configuration contract: the documented defaults, that
an environment variable overrides its default, that numeric fields are
coerced from the strings the environment always hands over, and that an
unknown setting is ignored rather than crashing the runner at startup.

Every construction passes `_env_file=None` so the tests are isolated from
whatever `runner/.env` or `~/.wso2-runner/.env` happens to exist on the
developer's machine; only the process environment (which monkeypatch
controls) is read.
