"""
Shared pytest fixtures for the backend test suite.

The app builds module-level state straight from the environment at import
time (`app/config.py`'s `Settings()`, `app/auth.py`'s Asgardeo userinfo URL,
`app/main.py`'s Azure `BlobServiceClient`), so every required setting must
already be in `os.environ` before `app.main` — or anything that imports it —
is imported for the first time anywhere in the test run. That's why the env
defaults below run before any `app.*` import in this file.

Tests exercise the FastAPI app over HTTP via `TestClient`, with two
dependencies overridden so no real Asgardeo account is needed and no fake
stands in for Azure Blob Storage:

- `get_current_user` -> a fake Engineer or Admin identity (`engineer_client`
  / `admin_client` fixtures below).
- `get_db` -> a session on a throwaway Postgres database, wrapped in a
  transaction that's rolled back after every test for per-test isolation
  (`db_session` fixture below).

Blob storage is *not* faked or overridden: routes that upload, sign or
delete files talk to a real Azurite emulator, exactly as they would talk to
real Azure in production (see the `blob_container` fixture below). This
follows the same reasoning as choosing Postgres over SQLite — tests then
assert the real property ("the file is gone") rather than an internal one
("we called delete_file").

Postgres was chosen over SQLite so Postgres-specific column types (e.g.
`DateTime(timezone=True)`, `JSON`) behave the same in tests as in production
— see issue #6/#7. A real Postgres must be reachable at `TEST_DATABASE_URL`
before running the suite, e.g.:

    docker run -d --name evidence-app-test-db \\
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres \\
        -e POSTGRES_DB=evidence_app_test -p 5433:5432 postgres:16

A real Azurite blob-storage emulator must also be reachable, at the host and
port baked into `AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING` below (`127.0.0.1:10000`
by default), e.g.:

    docker run -d --name evidence-app-test-blob -p 10000:10000 \\
        mcr.microsoft.com/azure-storage/azurite:latest \\
        azurite-blob --blobHost 0.0.0.0 --skipApiVersionCheck

    Autouse so this happens unconditionally at the start of the run, exactly
    like `db_engine`'s connectivity check — a test that doesn't explicitly
    ask for a storage fixture still needs the container to exist before any
    route under test tries to upload to it.

    Creating the container is the one "destructive-ish" setup step blob
    storage needs (parallel to `Base.metadata.create_all` for Postgres), so
    it must be idempotent across repeated runs of the suite: a container
    that already exists from a previous run is not an error.

    Teardown deletes every blob the run left behind, mirroring `db_engine`'s
    `drop_all` — without it, each run strands the blobs its uploads created
    (the database rows roll back, the blobs do not), and they accumulate in
    the emulator forever. The blobs are removed rather than the container
