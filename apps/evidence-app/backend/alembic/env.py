    Postgres 15+ only lets a schema's *owner* create objects inside it, so on
    a server where the app user does not own "public" — Azure Database for
    PostgreSQL is one, it hands "public" to its own admin role — migrations
    fail with a permission error before a single table exists. Creating a
    schema here means the app user owns it outright, which needs no grant
    from anyone.

    Three statements, three different jobs:

    - CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS makes the schema. The IF NOT EXISTS is what
      makes this safe to run on every pod restart, not just the first.
    - SET search_path fixes *this* connection, the one Alembic is about to
      run all the migrations on. ALTER DATABASE ... SET below does not reach
      a connection that is already open, and this one already is — skip
      this line and the tables still land in "public", or the CREATE TABLE
      fails with the original permission error, depending on what "public"
      allows.
    - ALTER DATABASE ... SET fixes every *future* connection to this
      database, which is what lets app/database.py go untouched: the app's
      own engine picks up the new default the same way a fresh psql session
      would.
